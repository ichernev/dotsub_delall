This very tiny extension is intended for users, who use http://dotsub.com to transcribe videos, but also want to alter the subtitle files offline. dotsub does not support uploading a new subtitle file, if the uploaded subtitles intersect with the already available subtitles. Clicking the icon of this extension will prompt you to delete all subtitles in the currently transcribed video, so you can upload new ones.

WARNING: If there are translations for that video ALL of them are deleted also. Use with caution!
