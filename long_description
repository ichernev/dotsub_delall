This very tiny extension is intended for users, who use http://dotsub.com to transcribe videos, but also want to alter the subtitle files offline. dotsub does not support uploading a new subtitle file, if the uploaded subtitles intersect with the already available subtitles. Clicking the icon of this extension will prompt you to delete all subtitles or a range given starting and ending time in the currently transcribed video, so you can upload new ones. In case you delete only a range, the uploaded file should match all non-deleted subtitles.

WARNING: If there are translations for that video ALL of them are deleted also. This operation is irreversible. Use with caution!
